# MyReads Project

MyRead is an app that allows you to search for books and put them in the right categorie : read, currently reading or Want to read

You can also remove a book from any of these 3 shelfs by selecting "none" juste below the corresponding book.

You can also search for books with the bottom right end corner button. Once you have added a couple of books on the right shelf, click the top left end corner to return to your shelfs

## TL;DR

To start the application, you will need to run :

- install all project dependencies with `npm install` or 'yarn install'
- start the development server with `npm start`
